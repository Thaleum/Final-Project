# Final-Project

It's pretty much the same setup as the Pitch just more complete, hopefully
I have 4 products setup as popup/clickable with some descriptions and the fake contact setup which I put in the Nav bar because I think it fits there
I looked around for different setups on the clickable/unclickable products ideas and found one that I liked for its simplicity and clean(er) looks. I will admit to looking at other CSS and HTML but only for the setup and basics, everything else is my own work
